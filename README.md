# Simple Python Calculator (CLI-Based)

This is a simple command-line calculator built in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, division, and subtraction between two numbers.

## 🔢 Features

- Addition
- Multiplication
- Division
- Subtraction
- User-friendly input and loop system
- Input validation for continuation choice

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter two numbers.
2. The user selects an operation (1-5).
3. The result is displayed.
4. The user can choose to continue or exit by entering 'y' or 'n'.

If the user enters anything other than 'y' or 'n', the program prompts them again until a valid input is given.

```bash
python3 --version
